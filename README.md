# Classic-Buffer-Overflows<br/>
Python scripts needed to perform a buffer overflow from a previously known vulnerable application or proof of concept.<br/>
The naming covention I am using is as follows<br/>
SX[ShortDescription].py<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where SX is the step number, followed by a short description.
